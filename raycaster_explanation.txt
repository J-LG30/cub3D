I cast the same amount of rays as the width of the game window.

stepx and stepy are variables eventually set to either 1 or -1 to indicate the direction in the
x and y axis that we will take a "step" in when performing the algorithm.

mapx and mapy are just int casts of the player position, so we can use it to access into
the map array to check if the rays have hit a wall.

player->planex and player->planey are form a vector that is perpendicular to the player direction.the rays pass through the plane at regular intervals.

to get the direction of the ray, when you add the plane and player direction together (because they're perpendicular vectors) and multiply it by a variable called camerax;
This multiplication serves to indication at which point the ray hits the camera plane, which affects the direction of the ray.
